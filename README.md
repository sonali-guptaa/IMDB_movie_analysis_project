# IMDB_movie_analysis_project
I performed the RCA(root cause analysis) to investigate what factors influence the success of a movie on IMDB? The impact of this problem is significant for movie producers, directors, and investors who want to understand what makes a movie successful to make informed decisions in their future projects. I have also performed data cleaning where i removed missing values, checking for outliers, removing duplicates and converting data types of the column etc.Then, I explored the data to understand the relationships between different variables and looked at the correlation between movie ratings and other factors like genre, director, budget and other relevant factors through chaarts and graphs. I have also used the five "Why" approach to  dig deeper into the problem. I also did descriptive analysis of the IMDB scores with other factors to find the factors that influence the IMDB ratings of a movie.
